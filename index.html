            My hometown is quintessentially "Texan", being home of the world's first rodeo and situtated within the top area for oil and natural 
            gas development in the Western Hemisphere. </p>

          <p>The town is also nestled between Texas' two National Parks — Big Bend NP & 
            Guadalupe Mountains NP (shown in the ensuing photos). Hence, my interest in the sphere that is natural resource policy. 
            I am a former champion rodeo cowboy, a diehard Texas Longhorn, and a solid golf scramble partner.</p>

              I previously served as the 2021 Senate Hispanic Research Council Luna Graduate Fellow — ultimately 
              becoming a lead natural resource and energy policy analyst in the Texas Senate. I earned my Master 
              of Public Service & Administration in the public policy analysis track from The Bush School of 
              Government at Texas A&M, where my concentration was in Energy/Environment/Technology Policy & Management (EETPM). 
              I earned my bachelors degree from The University of Texas - Austin.</p>
